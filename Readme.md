# Welcome

This is major mode for editing grammar files for haskell parser generator
[Happy](http://www.haskell.org/happy/), mostly indended for highlighting Happy
syntax along with Haskell syntax at the same time. MMM-mode is used to combine
two modes but editing commands from Haskell do not work in full as if pure Haskell
source was edited.

## Supported versions

Tested with emacs-24.3, should work with previous versions as well.
